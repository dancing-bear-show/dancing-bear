Scope
- Applies to all YAML configs under `config/`.

Guidelines
- Keep YAML simple and annotated with brief comments when needed.
- Favor unified files and `config derive` workflows to produce provider outputs.
- Do not store tokens, secrets, or PII here; use profiles in `~/.config/credentials.ini`.
