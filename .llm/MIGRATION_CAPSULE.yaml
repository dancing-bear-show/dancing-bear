paths:
  migration_state: .llm/MIGRATION_STATE.md
status:
  - Provider abstractions present (Gmail, Outlook)
  - Profile-aware credentials via ~/.config/sre-utils/credentials.ini
  - Outlook device-code split: outlook auth device-code → outlook auth poll
  - YAML IO helpers centralized; optional JSON cache helpers available
completed_work:
  - Unified filters source of truth established at config/filters_unified.yaml
  - Gmail labels/filters and Outlook rules wired through providers
  - CLI tree stabilized; wrappers in bin/ with consistent patterns
  - LLM capsules introduced (.llm/*) and lightweight llm CLI added
next_steps:
  - Gate features by provider capabilities (e.g., Outlook signatures unsupported)
  - Align Outlook rules caching with JSON cache helpers
  - Migrate any direct yaml.safe_* to yaml helpers in non-export paths
  - Expand tests for newly added CLI surfaces only (keep light)
backlog:
  - Sweep for secrets redaction in any logs
  - Optional: add concise README examples for new flows
