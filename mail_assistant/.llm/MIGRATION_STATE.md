Migration State

Unified Filters
- Source: `config/filters_unified.yaml`
- Coverage: simple Gmail rules fully unified; ongoing consolidation for retailers and finance domains.

Outlook Parity
- Default to move-to-folder derived from first added label (`--move-to-folders`).
- Use `--categories-only` when tenant policy blocks `forwardTo`.

Sweeps
- Gmail: 90-day inbox sweeps on actionable sets.
- Outlook: modest regular sweeps; aggressive with cache clear when needed.
