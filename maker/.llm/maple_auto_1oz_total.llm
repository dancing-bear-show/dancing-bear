Context:
“Maple auto 1oz total” denomination plaques (1 oz total, split into 1x, 2x half, 4x quarter, 10x tenth).

Status:
- STLs present for: 1x, 2x half, 4x quarter, 10x tenth under `maker/maple_auto_1oz_total/`

Constraints:
- Keep maple motif cleanly printable: minimum feature ≥ 0.5 mm.
- Text and numbers readable at 0.2 mm layers; emboss ≥ 0.6 mm.
- Plaque thickness ~2–3 mm; gentle back chamfer.

Ask:
Create a parametric OpenSCAD with:
- total_oz (1.0), parts (1,2,4,10), label_format (e.g., “1oz total — 4 × quarter oz”).
- motif toggle (maple on/off) and motif_scale.
Return presets for: 1x, 2x half, 4x quarter, 10x tenth.

Deliverables:
- Self-contained OpenSCAD source with simple maple outline (polygon or importable DXF option).
- Parameter sets for the four variants and recommended print orientation.
